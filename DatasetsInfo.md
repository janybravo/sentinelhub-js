# Dataset information

Most important info is Period / orbit time which is used for finding flyover times of orbits over a chosen area.
Orbit time is the time in which the satellite makes 1 circle around the Earth (or in the missions with 2 satellites, half the circle around the Earth as both satellites travel on the same track with approximately 180° difference).

# Copernicus

Copernicus missions consist of 1 or 2 satellites.
In mission with 2 satellites, the satellites are approximately 180° apart.
In that case the orbit time needs to be halfed as both satellites are traveling on (almost) the same track.

## Sentinel-1

Consists of 2 satellites: Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-1B

- 1 satellite:
  - Orbital cycle: 12 days
  - Orbits per cycle: 175
  - Calculated time for 1 orbit: ~98.742 min (should be the same as Period)
  - Period (time to circle the Earth 1 time = 1 orbit): 98.6 min
  - Revisit time (of the same area) on the equator: 12 days

- Both satellites:
  - Period: 98.6 min / 2 = **‭49.3 min**
  - Revisit time (of the same area): 12 days / 2 = 6 days

## Sentinel-2

Consists of 2 satellites: Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B

- 1 satellite:
  - Orbital cycle: 10 days
  - Orbits per cycle: 143
  - Calculated time for 1 orbit: ~100.699 min (should be the same as Period)
  - Period (time to circle the Earth 1 time by = 1 orbit): 100.6 min
  - Revisit time (of the same area) on the equator: 10 days

- Both satellites:
  - Period: 100.6 min / 2 = **50.3 min**
  - Revisit time (of the same area): 10 days / 2 = 5 days

- Both satellites:
  - Period: 100.99 min / 2 = **50.495 min**
